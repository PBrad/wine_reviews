0,"This is the finest Cheval Blanc for many years. It is, quite simply, magnificent. The wine shows the greatness of Cabernet Franc in the vintage, with 57% of the variety in the blend. It is beautifully structured and perfumed, with velvety tannins, balanced acidity and swathes of black-currant and black-cherry fruits. It's well on course to becoming a legendary wine.",100,1500.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,best reviews,variety
1,This is the latest release of what has long been regarded as Portugal's iconic wine. And it is magnificent. The last vintage was the 2004 and the wait has now shown to be worthwhile. With its immense span and breadth of flavors and rich structure it is a superb manifestation of the great vineyards of the Douro Superior. Big bold fruits and acidity are matched by the tannins and concentration. Hold this for many years or at least wait until 2022.,100,450.0,Portuguese Red,Portugal,best reviews,variety
2,"This is a magnificently solid wine, initially even a bit severe. At this young stage, the tannins dominate, but it's also full of black fruit notes. Very dense and concentrated, this is a wine that's even better than the legendary 2005. The structure tells of its extraordinary aging potential: don't even attempt to drink this for 10 years.",100,150.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,best reviews,variety
3,"This gorgeous, fragrant wine opens with classic Sangiovese scents of violet, rose, perfumed red berry, new leather and a whiff of baking spice. The elegant, radiant palate delivers crushed Marasca cherry, ripe strawberry, cinnamon, black tea and a hint of pipe tobacco. Firm, ultrafine tannins and bright acidity offer an age-worthy structure and impeccable balance. It's already stunning but will evolve for decades. Drink 2020–2050.",100,550.0,Sangiovese,Italy,best reviews,variety
4,"Almost black in color, this stunning wine is gorgeous, rich and dense. It's grand and powerful, with a strong sense of its own importance.

5,"In 2005 Charles Smith introduced three high-end Syrahs. In 2006 Smith has made a wine better than each of these, by combining them into a single wine—Royal City Syrah. Rich scents of purple fruit, smoked meat, cedar, lead pencil, moist earth and so on proclaim a wine with genuine gravitas. There is nothing missing, from the first sniff to the last sip, the wine delivers on all levels. Complex, beautifully balanced, powerful and detailed.",100,80.0,Syrah,US,best reviews,variety
6,"This wine dazzles with perfection. Sourced from vineyards throughout Sonoma County, it refutes the belief that a great Cabernet must come from a single vineyard. It does not. The master's art of blending, coupled with demanding vineyard practices lends completeness. The blend is 85% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Franc and 5% Malbec, making it an extraordinary success despite the absence of Cabernet Sauvignon. Give credit to winemaker Pierre Seillan. The wine itself is absolutely dry. It starts with a tug of tannins, baring flavors of blackberries, black currants, minerals and new oak, with earthy, herbal and meaty complexities. This is a magnificent wine; it dazzles now and should evolve over the next 6–8 years.",100,450.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,US,best reviews,variety
7,"This new release from a great vintage for Chardonnay in Champagne is a perfect blanc de blancs, showing a wealth of intensity from the crisp, chalky, mineral tones to the perfumed apple notes. The aromas hint at developing toastiness that adds depth and complexity. The wine is still young and it will age for years. Drink from 2020.",100,617.0,Chardonnay,France,best reviews,variety
8,"Tasted in a flight of great and famous Napa wines, this Cardinale stood at the head of the pack. Starts with a very fine nose of cedar, cassis, ripe blackberries and violets, then turns dramatic and refined in the mouth. Shows vast depth and length, with the finish a full minute of sweet fruits and spices. Marvelous tannins, so plush and elegant, so powerful yet refined. The grapes hail from Mt. Veeder, Howell Mountain, Stags Leap and Oakville, and the blend contains 14% Merlot. As good as it is now, it will improve for at least eight years.",100,200.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,best reviews,variety
9,"Initially a rather subdued Frog; as if it has been tamed down. Then, suddenly, There's a plush core of blackberry fruit, and the classic Cayuse funkiness is there, drenched in liquid rocks and cured meat and drying tannins. It's all in proportion and a fine reflection of the steely vintage. As it opens gracefully you discover that it is a stunningly refined Frog, quite possibly the best ever; powerful and distinctive, but also elegant, feminine.",100,80.0,Syrah,US,best reviews,variety
10,"A hugely powerful wine, full of dark, brooding tannins. It's a wine for seriously long-term aging, a sculptural vision of classic Bordeaux structure with with classy, ripe blackberry fruits. It has fresh acidity and an immense full-bodied character, cut through with mineral acidity. A great wine, with great potential.",100,359.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,France,best reviews,variety
11,"A perfect wine from a classic vintage, the 2007 Masseto (100% Merlot from a 17-acre vineyard of the same name) opens with an unabashedly opulent bouquet of delicious blackberry, cherry, chocolate, vanilla, exotic spice and cinnamon. Masseto excels both in terms of quality of fruit and winemaking and delivers plush, velvety tannins and an extra long, supple finish. It will make a special and valuable collection to your cellar.",100,460.0,Merlot,Italy,best reviews,variety
12,"This expresses the greatness of its vintage and vineyard, offering wave after wave of raspberry and cherry pie flavors, plus notes of red currant, sweet licorice, spicy Dr. Pepper and smoky sandalwood. There's also something exotically briary and wild that intrigues. Even more remarkable is the texture, an amalgam of acids and tannins that rivals any Pinot Noir ever produced in California. It should age for up to 20 years.",99,75.0,Pinot Noir,US,best reviews,variety
13,"Pure Chardonnay from the walled vineyard in the heart of Le Mesnil, this intense wine from a great vintage is tight and mineral, still showing hints of toast from its barrel fermentation. With its taut texture, complex acidity and crisp citrus, it's very young, but will age indefinitely. Showing the beauty of Chardonnay in Champagne at its best, it will certainly still be impressive come 2030.",99,800.0,Chardonnay,France,best reviews,variety
14,"A stupendous Pinot Noir, showing how beautifully this vineyard performs in the remote Sonoma Coast above Fort Ross. Williams Selyem's last few vintages of Precious Mountain have been extraordinary, but this 2009 tops them all. The wine is as light as a feather in the mouth, modest in alcohol and delicately feminine, like pure satin. However, few Pinot Noirs in the world achieve this level of concentration. Wild raspberries and cherries, cola, sleek minerals, dusty baking spices and smoky oak combine for flavors that are utterly delicious. After all that, it possesses an indefinable attribute of fascination. Will age well for a long time, if you can keep your hands off it. Now–2021.",99,94.0,Pinot Noir,US,best reviews,variety
15,"The flagship wine from Quilceda Creek offers exotic scents of plum, cassis, loam, coffee and pine sap, a rich and evocative blend. The wine delivers all that is promised and more; it is deep and dense with flavor, polished, focused and persistent. Vanilla, espresso, fine tannins, luscious acids and cascading fruits.",99,125.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,best reviews,variety
16,"There are incredible aromatics on this Cabernet. It's powerful yet subtle (how can that be?), all about sweet, crushed summer blackberries and pure cassis liqueur. Elaborate oak, in the form of buttered toast, is perfectly in balance, never overshadowing the fruit. The tannins are dry, rich and smooth, defining Napa elegance, grace and beauty. World class, dramatic and just about perfect, this gets better and better as it breathes in the glass. Drink now–2030.",99,150.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,best reviews,variety
17,"This is an absolutely beautiful wine to drink now, but the richness comes at the price of considerable alcohol. The color is dark and impenetrable, the aromas huge in Cabernet-inspired blackberries and black currants, with a touch of something herbal and also a stony minerality. There's also a fascinating peatiness, like an Islay Scotch. It really opens up in the glass, becoming ever more complex. It's great Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, but that high alcohol may limit its ageability.",99,290.0,Red Blend,US,best reviews,variety
18,"This is nearly perfect, a massive, monumental wine whose sheer power is matched only by its grace and refinement. The flavors of blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate, buttered toast and cedar flood the mouth, tightly controlled by firm tannins and good acidity. Decant for several hours if you open it now, but better to give it 6–10 years in the bottle.",99,100.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,best reviews,variety
19,"Dark and concentrated, this sends up complex aromas saturated with tar, asphalt, ink, steel, smoke and charred barbecue. It's a beautiful wine, tight and textural, in perfect balance, with superb depth, precision and elegance. The most contemplative of a superb 2011 Cayuse lineup, this wine above all needs your full attention.",99,75.0,Syrah,US,best reviews,variety
20,"This is the latest release of Portugal's most iconic wine. It's made only in selected years (the last vintage was 2000) from Ferreira's Quinta da Leda in the Douro Superior. This new vintage is superb. It's a richly tarry wine laden with dark plum fruits and tannins that are just beginning to mature. It's a ripe and luscious, demanding attention, yet will still age for many years. Drink now, or hold until 2020.",99,426.0,Portuguese Red,Portugal,best reviews,variety
21,"One of Italy's most iconic bottlings, the 2012 Sassicaia is drop-dead gorgeous. A blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Cabernet Franc, it boasts sensations of blue flowers, cedar, juicy red currants, ripe raspberries, white pepper and a balsamic note. Structured, radiant and loaded with finesse, it delivers everything you'd expect from a world-class wine and more. Drink 2018–2032.",99,235.0,Red Blend,Italy,best reviews,variety
22,"This is an elegant Nebbiolo-based wine and arguably the most feminine of Gaja's newest releases. There's extreme balance and sophistication evident in the focused aromas of wild berry, white licorice, pressed violets and polished stone. The mouthfeel is tight, firm and those tannins need at least 10 more years to soften in your cellar. Beautiful.",99,440.0,Nebbiolo,Italy,best reviews,variety
23,"Always a standout among Gaja's five single-vineyard wines, Sorì San Lorenzo benefits from an excellent vintage to produce what will surely become a must-have bottle for collectors of Italian wine. There's enormous beauty and elegance here, backed by power and intensity with ripe fruit, spice, toasted nut and cola. It also shows impressive linearity and focus. Hold for 10 years or more.",99,440.0,Nebbiolo,Italy,best reviews,variety
24,"Juicy and seductively smooth, this blockbuster beauty from the revered vineyard site is big, bold and intense, with granular tannins and a grip of integrated French oak. Its bright cassis, lavender, Tahitian vanilla and dried herb flavors are irresistible right out the gate. Ripe and rewarding, it's one to remember.",99,250.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,US,best reviews,variety
25,"Elegant and complex, this gorgeous wine is all about finesse, offering enticing aromas of rose petal, iris, perfumed berry, baking spices, anise and chopped aromatic herbs. The structured but silky palate seamlessly melds together juicy Morello cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, clove, licorice and tobacco while bright acidity and ultrafine tannins provide the framework. It's already tempting and impeccably balanced but will be even better in a few years. Drink 2018–2030.",99,175.0,Nebbiolo,Italy,best reviews,variety
26,"Perfumed berry, rose, new leather and dark spice are some of the enticing scents you'll find in this vibrant wine. It's still tightly wound but already dazzles with juicy wild cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, nutmeg and pipe tobacco flavors. Youthfully austere but noble tannins and bright acidity provide balance and serious aging potential. Don't be tempted to open it soon—the best is yet to come. Drink 2022–2042.",99,200.0,Sangiovese,Italy,best reviews,variety
27,"In a vintage that produced the finest overall lineup of Cayuse wines to date, it may seem a little nit-picky to score some higher and some lower. But the En Chamberlin deserves first place again. Brilliant aromatics of smoked meat, bacon fat and otherworldly roasted accents seduce instantly. Once on the palate, the silky, balanced, near-perfect mix of umami and fruit, plus licorice, cassis, coffee liqueur and black tea notes suggest it's as decadent as it is delicious.",99,75.0,Syrah,US,best reviews,variety
28,"In this great year for white Burgundy, Bâtard-Montrachet shines out as the epitome of balance between superb fruit and intense mineral and terroir characters. Its subtle touch of wood highlights the unctuous surface texture while just hinting at the steel sharpness of the structure beneath. Age this superb wine for at least 10 years.",99,560.0,Chardonnay,France,best reviews,variety
29,"Even better than the highly acclaimed 2001 vintage, this Merlot from a tiny, clay soil vineyard in Bolgheri is just about everything you've ever dreamed of tasting. Gorgeous, generous, voluptuous, cheerful, succulent and intense: Masseto is all those things. The aromas are seamless and capture the essence of chocolate fudge, sweet cherry, blackberry, spice and vanilla. It boasts thick, dense extraction, excellent structure and amazing persistence.",99,250.0,Merlot,Italy,best reviews,variety
30,"Here's a “wow” wine you won't easily forget. Messorio is all Merlot, and happily delivers the softness, richness and overall opulence that we love in this noble grape variety. What elevates this particular expression and vintage is the true elegance and sophistication evident here. This is a huge wine, but it's not exaggerated and the finish is as long and smooth as they come.",99,320.0,Merlot,Italy,best reviews,variety
31,"This stunning wine is all about extreme elegance and subtlety. It opens with aromas of wild red berry, rose petal, sweet baking spice and a whiff aromatic herb while the focused palate delivers red cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice, pipe tobacco and white pepper. A firm backbone of polished tannins and vibrant acidity gives it an age-worthy structure. It's loaded with finesse and should develop even more complexity over time. Drink 2018–2033.",99,595.0,Nebbiolo,Italy,best reviews,variety
32,"Shows classic, full-throttle notes of tropical and citrus fruits, pears and sweet green apples, combined with strong minerality and complex layers of buttered toast, honey and creamy lees. The description alone hardly does justice to the wine's beauty. The acidity is perfect, the oak deftly applied, the finish long and completely satisfying. Winemaker Ehren Jordan suggests pairing it with simple fare like roast chicken and salted fingerling potatoes.",99,44.0,Chardonnay,US,best reviews,variety
33,"Aromas of ripe black-skinned fruit, new leather, menthol and a whisper of blue flower unfold on this stunning, elegantly structured wine. The vibrant palate doles out ripe black cherry, cinnamon and star anise framed in firm, fine-grained tannins. Hold for even more complexity. Absolutely superb. Drink 2022–2035.",98,190.0,Sangiovese,Italy,best reviews,variety
34,"With layers upon layers of spicy saffron, peach, honey and caramel to be enjoyed on the nose alone, this heady botrytized Riesling is pure hedonism. The sweet-tart palate is deft and spry yet deeply lusciously penetrating in flavor. Spine-tingling acidity darts through a honeyed, waxy slick that extends the finish endlessly. It's already a heart-stopping wine but will continue to improve for decades to come.",98,775.0,Riesling,Germany,best reviews,variety
35,"Sourced from Red Willow, Olsen and Les Collines, this is the finest effort yet from Gramercy Cellars and one of the greatest Syrahs ever produced in Washington state. Think Hermitage with brighter fruit. It's intensely aromatic, dense and seamless, stacked with rich flavors of mixed berries, layers of smoke, earth and herb, and punctuated by citrusy acidity. Highlights of oranges and tangerines sneak into the finish, which lingers for an astonishingly long time. Exceptional in every way.",98,55.0,Syrah,US,best reviews,variety
36,"This is a best barrel blend of Goldeneye's several vineyards. It takes its beautifully ripe fruit from Confluence and the tannins of The Narrows to yield a dry, densely constructed and moderately ageable wine of exceptionally high quality and appeal. Blackberries, blueberries, cherries and exotic spices characterize the flavors of this tremendous wine, one of the best of the vintage out of the Anderson Valley. Only 222 cases were produced.",98,100.0,Pinot Noir,US,best reviews,variety
37,"Seductively smooth and intriguingly aromatic, this blend of several knock-out vineyards along Westside Road—Allen, Bacigalupi, Bucher, Rochioli Riverblock and Williams Selyem Estate—is instantly delicious, sharing a concentration of cherry, strawberry and citrus that perfectly captures the essence of the fruit, accented by a tease of black tea. An earthy minerality wraps around dry, polished tannins, with a streak of just-right acidity, giving it a realm of juiciness and flavorful sophistication. Enjoy through 2023.",98,69.0,Pinot Noir,US,best reviews,variety
38,"In recent years, Precious Mountain Vineyard has provided Bob Cabral with some of his most glorious fruit. Tremendous in flash and depth, it offers compelling flavors of raspberry and cherry, accented by sweet, smoky oak. There's such complexity in the acid and tannin structure, and in the earthy, stony, spicy nuances, that you find something new to love with every sip. This masterpiece is fabulous now, and will develop bottle complexity over the next 15 years, at least.",98,94.0,Pinot Noir,US,best reviews,variety
39,"Immensely inviting, this opens with fragrant pipe tobacco, crushed berry, new leather and pressed violet aromas. On the palate, firm, refined tannins underpin juicy black cherry, raspberry and cinnamon flavors, while orange zest accents and an energizing mineral note lift the finish. It's beautifully balanced with bright acidity and will reward a bit of cellaring. Drink 2020–2032.",98,95.0,Sangiovese,Italy,best reviews,variety
40,"New leather, mature black-skinned fruit, tilled soil and a touch of dark spice are some of the aromas you'll find on this fantastic, full-bodied red. The big, velvety palate shows power and finesse, offering mouthfuls of juicy wild cherry, black raspberry, licorice, Mediterranean herb and a note of exotic spice framed in firm, ripe tannins. It's already balanced and delicious, but hold for more complexity. Drink 2020–2035.",98,120.0,Sangiovese,Italy,best reviews,variety
41,"This stunning wine opens with classic Nebbiolo aromas of new leather, rose, wild berry, crushed herb, dark spice and menthol.

42,"Here's a “wow” wine on every level, with incredible intensity and supple softness that builds momentum over many long minutes. A sweet cherry note at the core is surrounded by lush layers of tobacco, dark chocolate and spice, which promise to evolve gracefully over years to come.",98,102.0,Red Blend,Italy,best reviews,variety
43,"This is a hopelessly gorgeous wine with so much energy, intensity, density and good cheer. The superb ensemble—Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot—delivers chocolate fudge, ripe cherry, rhubarb, cola, tobacco and cedar wood. It's tight and supple, with seamless harmony and excellent succulence on the finish. But it's that incredible intensity that truly sets this wine apart.",98,175.0,Red Blend,Italy,best reviews,variety
44,"Chapoutier's selections of the best parcels of vines in Hermitage are set to become legendary. Sold under the ancient spelling of the appellation name (Ermitage), they represent the epitome of the power and concentration that lies behind the reputation of the appellation. This cuvée is the best of the collection, with its brooding, opaque character, suggesting rather than revealing power at this stage. Age it until your new-born baby is old enough to drink, and it will be just about ready.",98,150.0,Rhône-style Red Blend,France,best reviews,variety
45,"The opulence of this sparkling wine has to be tasted to be believed. It's far softer and silkier than the winery's companion new release, the 2005 J. Schram, but then the blend is the complete opposite. This one's mainly Pinot Noir, with the balance from Chardonnay. The Pinot Noir brings a warm, raspberry- and cherry-sauce richness to Chardonnay's limes and pears, while an extraordinarily delicious toastiness pervades the whole, as if it had been gently smoked. So enticing now, it's hard to keep from drinking the whole bottle, and you certainly can, but this is a wine that will age for 10–15 years.",98,110.0,Sparkling Blend,US,best reviews,variety
46,"An awesome rosé, just a tremendous feat. Made from 11 vineyards in 4 counties, it shows a masterful art of the blend. Insanely rich in toasted bread and lees, showing the influence of six years in the bottle. A tremendous core of strawberries, raspberries, orange zest, roasted macadamia, roasted coconut, pear liqueur and honey lasts into the finish. Despite the richness, the wine is dry. So lovely now you can hardly keep your hands off, but it should age gracefully for the next 10–15 years.",98,130.0,Sparkling Blend,US,best reviews,variety
47,"This is yet another stunning wine from this site, guided by the capable hands of Winemaker and Viticulturalist Bibiana González Rave, who has coaxed from it beguiling layers of complex concentration and sublime notions of tang and salt. The only white from a sea of Pinot Noir grown here, it speaks to what the extreme Sonoma Coast can bring to the variety—a celebration of lemon zest, crisp apple and brioche delicately wrapped in minerality.",98,80.0,Chardonnay,US,best reviews,variety
48,"A tremendous achievement in Merlot. The vineyard, around 1,600 feet up on Mt. Veeder, is now owned by the Jackson family, and the winemaker is Chris Carpenter, who oversees Cardinale. In fact, this Merlot bears an uncanny resemblance to Cardinale in the dramatically ripe, sweet fruit and superb, tannin-based structure. It's 100% Merlot, with hefty yet balanced alcohol, and the wine easily handles the 85% new French oak in which it was aged for 22 months.",98,60.0,Merlot,US,best reviews,variety
49,"Red berry, cedar and light spice aromas lead the way on this dazzling red. The vibrant palate is loaded with finesse, delivering bright red currant, red raspberry, white pepper and chopped herb alongside bright acidity and firm, polished tannins. Impeccably balanced, it's loaded with elegance, energy and intensity but it's still young, so give it time to fully develop. Drink 2020–2038.",98,235.0,Red Blend,Italy,best reviews,variety
50,"This is an incredibly beautiful and yes, joyful, sparkler, made from equal parts Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. This particular offering was disgorged in July 2016. It positively impresses in minerality, complemented by a more fulsome sense of lemon, apple and hazelnut on the creamy palate, leaving a rich trail of silk on the finish.",98,250.0,Sparkling Blend,US,best reviews,variety
51,"Solid as a battleship, with lemony oak, marzipan and layer upon layer of black fruit aromas. Almost syrupy in its richness but not fully; it's chewy and creamy, with vital acids. The flavors are mega ripe and rich, emphasizing blackberry, black cherry preserves, fudge and fig paste. Yet at the same time it's an ethereal wine; the epitome of modern Rioja. Drink now through 2015.",97,250.0,Tempranillo,Spain,best reviews,variety
52,"So incredibly thick and sweet it's almost chewy in texture, with aromas and flavors that feature a fascinating interplay of fresh and dried apricots, peach and citrus, kept lively by healthy acidity. The finish lasts for minutes; the wine should age well for decades.",97,486.0,Riesling,Germany,best reviews,variety
53,"The smoky, minerally aspects of the site show through even a thick veil of botrytis. This is intensely honeyed, filled with dried apricot and candied pineapple flavors, yet not without nuance. Incredibly sweet, but as balanced as a wine this unctuous can be, with a long, mouthwatering finish.",97,,Riesling,Germany,best reviews,variety
54,"Dusty, saffron-spiced earthiness is juxtaposed against intense mango and tangerine fruitiness in this deeply complex wine. It's unctuously sweet, but balanced by a piercing streak of acidity that penetrates through the midpalate. Spry and silken, it finishes on a long lingering whisper of honey and peach.",97,775.0,Riesling,Germany,best reviews,variety
55,"The phenomenal 2010 vintage shows why this wine is considered Italy's top purebred Merlot. Revealing structure, finesse and mesmerizing depth, it delivers blackberries, currants, cedar, exotic spices and mocha alongside firm, polished tannins and fresh acidity. It's well balanced with fantastic length and while it's delicious now, hold for more complexity. Drink 2015–2030.",97,550.0,Merlot,Italy,best reviews,variety
56,"This Ferreirinha Douro Superior wine is made in exceptional years. The 2007 is the 16th vintage since 1960 (the previous release was 2003). It is an immense wine in its grandeur while being sophisticated and structured. There are complex flavors from the long wood aging. The dark, dense black fruits are impressive while perfectly meshed into the concentrated tannins and black currant acidity. This wine, even at nine years, is young, and should not be drunk before 2020 (or decanted if you can't wait).",97,250.0,Portuguese Red,Portugal,best reviews,variety
57,"Exceeds even this producer's stunning beerenauslese, featuring an even more intoxicating perfume of honey, dried apricots and candied pineapple, with slightly more acidity to provide balance to the extra level of sweetness, so much so that this wine comes across as refreshing on the finish, despite the incredibly high levels of sugar. Drink now–2050, possibly longer.",97,245.0,Riesling,Germany,best reviews,variety
58,"This wine is dominated by Touriga Nacional, which offers a backbone of dark tannins that gives it a firm structure and will allow it to age for many years. Produced in open stone lagares, it has richness and impressive opulence in black fruit tones that are cut by juicy acidity. Drink from 2022.",97,100.0,Portuguese Red,Portugal,best reviews,variety
59,"Available in magnum only, this is an occasional bottling from the winery. A winery spokeperson told me my bottle was entirely 1993 vintage, but not all other bottles are. The wine is extraordinarily fine, but compared to other California bubblies, it's sandpapery and almost harsh at this point. As it warms up in the glass it shows an immense toasted nut and grilled fruit richness with an impossibly long finish. This is one to stash for the long haul.",97,147.0,Sparkling Blend,US,best reviews,variety
60,"This wine is insanely good, from a dry-farmed, yes, rocky outcropping of vines planted first in 1910, then again in 1934 and the 1970s, with Carignane and Petite Sirah in the mix. It's thick, rich and beautifully put-together, full bodied and entirely balanced, with markings of cherry cordial and white pepper that seduce gently.",97,50.0,Zinfandel,US,best reviews,variety
61,"A triumph, really. Held back for 14 years and just recently disgorged, it's fantastically rich and complex, just oozing the most delicious orange, butterscotch, yeast and toast flavors. So silky, so sweet in fruit, and yet with a dry finish. Stands out in any tasting of the best sparklers. Hard to imagine a California bubbly better than this.",97,179.0,Sparkling Blend,US,best reviews,variety
62,"The estate wine from Mouchão is always a great wine. This latest release, almost black in color and five-years-old, is hugely rich, powered by black fruits and juicy acidity. Made principally from Alicante Bouschet, it shows the power and the aging potential of this variety in the Alentejo. This wine, foot-trodden in open stone lagars, is destined for much longer aging. Drink at the earliest in 2021.",97,75.0,Portuguese Red,Portugal,best reviews,variety
63,"A true labor of love, this fabulous Vin Santo opens with beautiful intensity and infinite aromas of roasted chestnut, maple syrup, caramel, butterscotch and candied orange. It's divine in the mouth, with thick, luscious layers of glycerine and succulent sweetness. This is what Italians call a meditation wine that can easily be consumed alone after dinner.",97,,White Blend,Italy,best reviews,variety
64,"Jean-Louis, the son of Gérard Chave, is now in charge of the family business, as well as being president of the Hermitage wine producers. He is continuing the family tradition of making powerful statements of Syrah from Hermitage, combining massive structure and over-powering perfumes. This 1999 seems to have the best of the traditional world of tannic immensity and the modern world of beautiful, ripe fruit. A wine that will age for a very long time.",97,125.0,Rhône-style Red Blend,France,best reviews,variety
65,"Made with Malvasia Toscano and Trebbiano grapes (unlike the slightly more complex Occhio di Pernice Vin Santo, which is made from Sangiovese), this is a delightfully rich and concentrated sweet wine that boasts unreal levels of intensity and personality. The wine is smooth and round with lingering notes of brown sugar, roasted almond, melted sugar, dried apricots and figs.",97,170.0,White Blend,Italy,best reviews,variety
66,"If the color doesn't tell the full story, the nose will: it's impeccably perfumed, round and sweet, with amazing fruit aromas and a toasty background. The feel is as lush and rich as they come, and there's outstanding purity to the lusty black fruit flavors. A masher with elegance. Maybe the best Malbec Argentina has ever produced. Drink from 2011–15.",97,120.0,Malbec,Argentina,best reviews,variety
67,"The heady, pure perfume of fig rind and foliage streams from the glass. A more tart and tropical note of passion fruit pitches in as well, along with green grapefruit spice. The aromatic spectrum is a sublimation of exotic fruit on nose and palate. The palate sustains this high-pitched balance by the purest lightening strike of zesty acidity. Even the tiniest drop of this amber liquid has the power to perfume the entire palate for minutes. The concentration is immense, the flavors are mind-boggling. This is high-octane stuff guaranteed to blow your mind. Drink now or cellar it through 2040 at least.",97,95.0,White Blend,Austria,best reviews,variety
68,"This ethereal Tokaji Aszú is golden in color, with aromas of delicate acacia flower, honeysuckle, fresh peach and tinned apricot. The flavors come alive on the palate, showing luscious apricot, floral honeycomb and fresh pear juice. The acidity is perfectly balanced to prevent this delightful wine from being too cloying.",97,80.0,White Blend,Hungary,best reviews,variety
69,"Lusty aromas of black cherry and blackberry are powerful. Likewise, this Tempranillo from just outside the Ribera del Duero district tastes bullish, with blackberry, currant, mocha and rich oak flavors. Robust berry fruit along with spice and chocolate are the lead flavors on a strong, dense finish. This has the potential to age nicely for seven to 15 years. Drink through 2030.",96,100.0,Tempranillo,Spain,best reviews,variety
70,"Even though the 42 months this wine has spent in new wood give it an intensely toasty character, the enormously soft, perfumed fruits and ripe, sweet flavors that go along with the wood produce a finely tuned, balanced wine that should age well over many years. As an expression of pure Syrah, there are few better.",96,175.0,Rhône-style Red Blend,France,best reviews,variety
71,"Everything about this stately Ribera heavyweight impresses. The nose is outright oaky, so expect derivative aromas of toast, clove, cinnamon and spice to go with black-fruit scents. This remains firm, tannic and tightly wrapped, with massive blackberry, chocolate and toast flavors. Peppery spice, brooding mixed-berry flavors and mouth-coating tannins endow a finish that signals that this has many good years ahead of it. Drink from 2018–2032.",96,351.0,Tempranillo,Spain,best reviews,variety
72,"Clover, white pepper, and a whiff of animal make this blend of 75% Mourvèdre, 20% Syrah and 5% Grenache compelling now, but it's certainly a wine to cellar. The aromas move through a spectrum of flower, spice, fruit and animal. It already displays tremendous length and superb aging potential.",96,45.0,Rhône-style Red Blend,US,best reviews,variety
73,"On the nose, a blast of beeswax and honey provides heady lift. The palate is tooth-breakingly sweet but comes with that honeyed, candied-citrus thrill. Sufficient bright acidity counters all the richness. The mouthfeel is full, oily and viscous, always with that honeycomb and beeswax note, not quite tipping into the savoriness of maple syrup. Despite all the decadent sweetness, the finish is still lip-smacking, clean and endless.",96,160.0,White Blend,Austria,best reviews,variety
74,"Jammy, creamy and superripe, with raspberry, burnt toast and coffee on the thick, meaty nose. Flavors reminiscent of an ice cream sundae work the palate, which means berry syrup, chocolate sauce and vanilla are highly prominent. Texturally speaking, this is a smooth, soft and plush wine. It pushes the envelope on ripeness, but that's become the Cirsion way. An awesome wine that deserves a proper decanting.",96,303.0,Tempranillo,Spain,best reviews,variety
75,"This is the third vintage of a wine from a single parcel of ungrafted vines, produced in a walled vineyard within the ruins of the Sancerre city walls. The vines are a selection from the family's Les Romains vineyard. It cannot be labeled Sancerre because of the experimental methods used in its production. The wine is young, needing to age to develop its concentrated fruits and rich apple and apricot flavors. Tight and tense at this stage, it will develop slowly. Drink this rare wine from 2019.",96,,Sauvignon Blanc,France,best reviews,variety
76,"This vineyard continues to impress in both this variety and others, this wine showing off its ability to offer fistfuls of red, blue and black fruit as juicy acidity signals freshness and ageability. A wooded undertone of brush and bramble meets swathes of lavender, licorice and ever-so-satisfying dark chocolate as the length of the wine goes on for days.",96,62.0,Zinfandel,US,best reviews,variety
77,"Just when you think Alta Vista has gotten everything it can from Temis (see the 2012), this comes along to reset the benchmark. Ripe, round and lush on the nose, with full-force blackberry and prune aromas, this shows titanic grip, depth and ripeness on the palate. Flavors of raisin, chocolate and blackberry finish with hefty tannins and a smear of mocha flavor. Drink from 2018–2026.",96,48.0,Malbec,Argentina,best reviews,variety
78,"Right now this is still shy on the nose. There is a glint of pear peel and Mirabelle, plus a suggestion of smoke. The palate is equally shy as the principal sensation is that of wonderfully tangy texture, fresh concentrated acidity and balanced sweetness right now. This needs time to develop its undoubtedly rich flavors. The balance is impeccable. Immense power and lasting strength lie at the core of this monumental wine. This is made to last and should be given time in the cellar. Drink 2025–2050.",96,60.0,Pinot Gris,France,best reviews,variety
79,"Earth, smoke and lifted lemon peel create a very alluring, almost primal aroma. The palate comes in with gentle, subdued sweetness, boosting ripe pear notes before revealing fir honey bitterness and tangy grapefruit zest. A warm sandalwood-spiced core is still tightly closed, holding further stores of fruit and spice and signalling lasting power and barely tamed energy. While aromas are enticing now this deserves cellaring to come into its own. There is much drive and a dynamic citrus freshness wills you to sip more. This draws you in dangerously. The finish is dry and totally enticing. Drink 2020–2040.",96,120.0,Pinot Gris,France,best reviews,variety
80,"Barley sugar, butterscotch, demerara sugar and the faintest hint of maple syrup suggest the richness of this SGN right away. The concentrated sweetness is countered with illuminating freshness and holds tons of tangy spice. Wow. This is incredibly concentrated and has an elixir-like bundled energy that seems to be alive. The effect is both mesmerizing and invigorating.",96,80.0,Pinot Gris,France,best reviews,variety
81,"This is a beautiful, complex and complete wine, from the delicate, spiced raspberry aroma through the creamy, nuanced finish. Subtle but well-defined fruit flavors like white cherry and raspberry pulse across the palate, buoyed by an ultrafine effervescence and lively acidity. But the texture is smooth around the edges, lending a sense of extra depth and layering to this extraordinary bottle. Just coming into its own now, it will improve through at least 2020.",96,150.0,Rosé,US,best reviews,variety
82,"A perennial knockout, this vintage delivers as always, combining 7% Petite Sirah, Mourvèdre and Syrah from the estate into the mix. Altogether, it opens in a field of wildflowers aromatic before unfurling tart acidity to keep freshly layered soft, supple tannin and red cherry and berry. Sprinklings of white pepper and clove factor in.",96,58.0,Zinfandel,US,best reviews,variety
83,"The 2010 Beaucastel is a tour de force, brilliantly combining espresso and black olive notes with bright raspberry fruit, while dark earthy notes provide a solid base. The feel on the palate is ample, with tannins that are a bit dusty but not tough or chewy. The long, mouthwatering finish bodes well for the future. Drink now–2030.",96,120.0,Rhône-style Red Blend,France,best reviews,variety
84,"While this is the top wine of a major Cahors estate, it is impressive how restrained it is. Sure, the wood and dense brooding black fruits are there, but they have been subtly controlled by the freshness of the wine and its great balance. With its richness, still youthful fruit and its structure it will need aging. Drink from 2020.",96,120.0,Malbec,France,best reviews,variety
85,"The most impressive of the fine range of wines from this producer, the wine is structured and dense without ever losing sight of balance, fruit and acidity. That makes for a wine that has a dusty texture coupled with a dry center of fruit and wood tannins. The acidity and the juicy berry fruits give freshness. Everything is ready for long aging. Drink from 2019.",95,60.0,Malbec,France,best reviews,variety
86,"From a prime site planted in 1910 and brought back to life in recent years, this is a juicy, rustic wine that's lengthy and boldly crafted—a hint of mushroomy earthiness providing an intriguing additional layer of flavor to the fruity raspberry and strawberry. There's black pepper and cinnamon spice lurking in the background, waiting to exhale. Drink now through 2023.",95,46.0,Zinfandel,US,best reviews,variety
87,"Wow. This is an incredible wine, as always, but particularly soft and structured in this fine vintage, which deftly marries pretty aromatics and zippy acidity with darker, stormier elements of ripe fig and wood smoke. There's so much complexity and life going on, it'll be hard to wait on this one, though more time in the bottle should make everything that much more settled and complete. Drink now through 2023.",95,47.0,Zinfandel,US,best reviews,variety
88,"This vintage is even better than the prior version, which is almost unimaginable, but there it is. Floral and as tempting as blueberry pie, this concoction from Jesse Katz is velvety smooth and silky on the palate. White chocolate dances around its edges, along with a strong suggestion of cigar, which may perhaps come from the fine lady on the label.",95,125.0,Malbec,US,best reviews,variety
89,"The wine abounds with intensity, richness and power as well as mouthwatering freshness. It is very ageworthy and certainly the most impressive wine from Henri Bourgeois, a tour de force of Sauvignon Blanc.",95,50.0,Sauvignon Blanc,France,best reviews,variety
90,"The “Essence” in the designation refers to the wine's sources, which are selected blocks from the winery's vineyards in the southern part of Napa. The wine is absolutely dry, mouthwatering in acidity, and vastly complex. There's a touch of smoky, vanilla-scented French oak, but the fruit flavors star. They suggest stone-driven minerals, Meyer lemons, limes, white peaches, pink grapefruits and a savory, umami-rich note of figs. The wine is ideal now and should evolve for many years.",95,50.0,Sauvignon Blanc,US,best reviews,variety
91,"A floral touch of honeysuckle plays spicily on the nose alongside aromatic Williams pear. The palate adds a sonorous and pleasant bitterness to this, reminiscent of fir honey, while the floral overtones of honeysuckle shimmer everywhere. There is quite some warmth and energy in this wine, smouldering at the very core. This is lovely now but is sure to last with all its brooding power. The finish is long and dry and returns to that pure note of Williams pear. Drink 2017–2035.",95,85.0,Pinot Gris,France,best reviews,variety
92,"Heady notes of chamomile and dried hay flower stream from the glass immediately hinting at a wine with some evolution. A touch of candied lemon peel makes the nose even more enticing. The palate is generous but dry, showing off the pristine pear fruit and wonderful phenolic texture that gives as much structure to this wine as its fine pure lemony acidity. Savored slowly, the full depth of pure pear fruit becomes apparent. This is a class act just coming into its drinking window now, with ample potential for further aging. Drink 2017–2035.",95,75.0,Pinot Gris,France,best reviews,variety
93,"Named in honor of the Romans who first planted vines in Sancerre, this wine has its feet firmly in the chalk soil that gives it richness as well as minerality. Ripe with touches of yellow fruits as well as lime and other citrus flavors, it is structured, dense and likely to age well. Drink from 2018.",95,65.0,Sauvignon Blanc,France,best reviews,variety
94,"Superb at every checkpoint, this is a world-class wine. Cherry, cassis and earth aromas are spicy and mellow, not bullish or loud. This feels creamy but with enough textural grit to keep things lively, while flavors of vanilla, tobacco and plum are nicely integrated. A mild, medium-long finish epitomizes elegance. Drink now through 2025.",95,89.0,Tempranillo,Spain,best reviews,variety
95,"From selected, sunny parcels of vines, it's powered by its citrus and pear fruits along with an intensely mineral texture and supreme concentration. It's a Sancerre to keep, still young and gawky, best drunk from 2016.",95,55.0,Sauvignon Blanc,France,best reviews,variety
96,"This is a serious wine with a lighter brighter side. Its wood aging adds spice to the ripe red fruits and brings out the concentration and intensity. It is, in its way, an unexpected side of Provence rosé, emphasizing richness and complexity. But it all comes together: a fine wine that, after a year of aging, is ready to drink.",94,100.0,Rosé,France,best reviews,variety
97,"This is one of the classics among Provence rosés. Produced from organically grown grapes and coming from an impressive red-wine producing estate east of Aix-en-Provence, the wine is structured and ageworthy with its blend that includes Cabernet Sauvignon. Rich and full of red fruits, the wine should be drunk from late 2017.",94,20.0,Rosé,France,best reviews,variety
98,"This memorably beautiful and delicious wine is made from estate-grown Grenache. The grapes weren't designated for saignee, but rather picked specifically to make this tart and tangy expression of an inviting grape. Orange in color, almost like a beer, it's dry and sneakily succulent, with inviting floral aromas at its core and enough body to stay interesting as it develops.",94,26.0,Rosé,US,best reviews,variety

It is an immense wine in its grandeur while being sophisticated and structured. There are complex flavors from the long wood aging. The dark, dense black fruits are impressive while perfectly meshed into the concentrated tannins and black currant acidity. This wine, even at nine years, is young, and should not be drunk before 2020 (or decanted if you can't wait).",97,250.0,Portuguese Red,Portugal,best reviews,country

247,"Touches of vanilla, cream and lovely hints of oatmeal allude to developing, evolving autolytic notes. These are edged with pure lemon, giving equal expression to emollience and freshness. On the midpalate the creamy, generous richness of yeast comes through, providing stucture and a canvas against which tart apple and Amalfi lemon can play. Depth and serious intent shows amid the sensuously fine fizz. Although this wine is refreshing and bright now, more bottle age will make it even more alluring.

Flashy, sweet-scented oak (think maple syrup and toasted coconut) marks the nose, while concentrated cassis and vanilla flavors coat the palate.

251,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (62.5%), Merlot (25%) and Cabernet Franc (12.5%) is aged in one-third new French oak for 10 months, resulting in a lovely marriage of vanilla and cedar with cassis.
